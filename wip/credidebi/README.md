# CrediDebi – Smart Ledger Website (Work in Progress)

CrediDebi is a smart ledger website designed to help small shopkeepers
digitally track their credit and debit records instead of maintaining
handwritten notebooks.

I havent added any framework and database and backend yet . I have used html and css , with javascript for functions along with certain api s.

Almost everything is done till js , but still some debugging is needed since some functions are not working properly and some finishing for ui/ux as well as other things.
